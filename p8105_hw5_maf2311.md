# Problem 1

A tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the
subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

Tidied result - file names include control arm and subject ID

``` r
final = 
  full_df %>% 
  mutate(
    names = str_replace(names, ".csv", ""),
    group = str_sub(names, 1, 3)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "outcome",
    names_prefix = "week_") %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) %>% 
  select(group, subj = names, week, outcome)
```

### Spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time

``` r
final %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = outcome, group = subj, color = group)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_path() + 
  facet_grid(~group)
```

In this plot, you can see the control group does not change much over
time, whereas the experimental group increases significantly by the end
of week 8.

# Problem 2

Homicides in 50 large US cities, Washington Post

``` r
homicides = read_csv(file = "./data-homicides-master/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state)
  )
```

The raw data includes variables related to the record information,
victim information, location, and notes about the record. There are
52179 records and 12 variables. I created a variable that combines the
city and the state information, to have 13 variables total.

``` r
baltimore = summary %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

unsolved_prop_baltimore = prop.test(baltimore$unsolved[1], baltimore$total_homicides[1]) %>%
  broom::tidy()

# Problem 3

When designing an experiment or analysis, a common question is whether
it is likely that a true effect will be detected – put differently,
whether a false null hypothesis will be rejected. The probability that a
false null hypothesis is rejected is referred to as power, and it
depends on several factors, including: the sample size; the effect size;
and the error variance. In this problem, you will conduct a simulation
to explore power in a one-sample t-test.

First set the following design elements:

Fix n=30 Fix σ=5 Set μ=0. Generate 5000 datasets from the model

x∼Normal\[μ,σ\]

For each dataset, save μ̂ and the p-value arising from a test of H:μ=0
using α=0.05. Hint: to obtain the estimate and p-value, use broom::tidy
to clean the output of t.test.

Repeat the above for μ={1,2,3,4,5,6}, and complete the following:

Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected (the
power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis.
Describe the association between effect size and power. Make a plot
showing the average estimate of μ̂ on the y axis and the true value of μ
on the x axis. Make a second plot (or overlay on the first) the average
estimate of μ̂ only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y
axis and the true value of μ on the x axis. Is the sample average of μ̂
across tests for which the null is rejected approximately equal to the
true value of μ? Why or why not?
